    "- Port 80 (HTTP): Checked for XSS/CSRF issues, none detected.  \n",

    "- Older SSLv3 protocol is enabled, confirming exposure to the **POODLE vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566)**.\n",
    "- Several weak cipher suites (e.g., `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`) are still accepted.\n",

    "- Disable SSLv3 completely in server configuration.\n",
    "- Restrict accepted cipher suites to strong modern algorithms (AES-GCM, SHA256, TLS 1.2+).\n",

    "### **Day 9: Cross-Host Comparison and Risk Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "The Nmap scan comparison across hosts revealed that the following ports are common across all responding devices:  \n",
    "`21/tcp (FTP)`, `53/tcp (DNS)`, `80/tcp (HTTP)`, `443/tcp (HTTPS)`, and `5555/tcp (Freeciv)`.  \n",
    "No host-specific unique ports were detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- **FTP (21/tcp)** — Often exposed; must ensure authentication and disable anonymous logins.  \n",
    "- **DNS (53/tcp)** — Core network service, but should not allow recursive queries from external clients.  \n",
    "- **HTTP/HTTPS (80/443)** — Web interfaces could expose administrative portals or misconfigurations.  \n",
    "- **Port 5555 (Freeciv)** — Unexpected; likely indicates a development or test service. Should be verified and restricted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "All hosts share a similar attack surface, meaning a single unpatched service (like the SSL POODLE vulnerability from Day 3) could affect the entire subnet.  \n",
    "The network exhibits a uniform configuration but lacks service isolation — a key security improvement area.\n"

    "| **Encryption** | Enforce HTTPS with updated TLS versions; disable SSL 3.0. | High | Prevents SSL POODLE and MITM attacks. |\n",
    "| **FTP Service** | Switch to SFTP or FTPS. | Medium | Ensures encrypted file transfer. |\n",
    "| **Patch Management** | Regularly update firmware/software. | Medium | Prevents CVE-related vulnerabilities. |\n",
    "| **Logging & Monitoring** | Enable detailed access logs and intrusion detection alerts. | Medium | Helps detect suspicious activity early. |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "To consolidate and review all network scan results (Days 1–11) and produce a unified vulnerability and service-risk summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks Completed:**\n",
    "- Merged all Nmap vulnerability outputs into a master CSV file.\n",
    "- Verified findings across all discovered hosts (192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.4, etc.).\n",
    "- Combined port/service mapping with vulnerability classifications.\n",
    "- Organized final dataset for visualization and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- Most active host: 192.168.1.1, running FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS.\n",
    "- Moderate risk found due to **SSL POODLE (CVE-2014-3566)** and possibly outdated web server versions.\n",
    "- Other hosts (192.168.1.4, 192.168.1.7, etc.) showed closed or filtered ports, indicating better security posture.\n",
    "- Overall network posture is stable, with one high-priority host for patch review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Day 13 → Capture all final screenshots, finalize tables and visual elements.\n",
    "- Day 14 → Prepare and record video presentation (scan flow, findings, notebook walkthrough).\n",
    "- Day 15 → Compile final submission (Jupyter Notebook, PDF Report, Video).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ *End of Day 12 – Data Consolidation Phase Completed*\n"
